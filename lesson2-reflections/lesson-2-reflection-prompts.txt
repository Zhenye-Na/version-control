What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	git init
	It said 'Initial Commit' and all the files are stay in the 'untracked files' 
	status. Later, you can use 'git add' command to add the files to Staging Area.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The Staging Are is kind of the transition mode of your git commit. You first 
	'git add' the files to Staging Area. That will not directly commit your files
	to repository. Rhis may help if you select a wrong file and you delete ('git reset')
	or you think the files are enough and you can commit to your repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	One commit for only one stage of your project.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Where the asterisk (*) is, it indicates the branch you currently are.
