When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe show other people what you recently work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatically updating is good, but it will update so frequent that you may
    not remember what you changed in your projects.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branche: files are not necessarily be linear all the time, sometimes a 
    		 tree-like structure.
    Fork: 	 'copy' the files directly to your remote repository without needing
    	     cloning then add to Github.
   	Clone:   clone repository from remote to your local or clone from local to 
   	         other local directory

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In case of reverting your projects.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    USB Flash Drive or Wechat.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Demo version of projects.
