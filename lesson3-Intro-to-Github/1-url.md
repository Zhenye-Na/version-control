## Copy the HTTPS URL, not the SSH URL!
Please click on the `HTTPS` button and copy the URL that shows up for HTTPS. It will begin with `https://` rather than `git@github.com`.

If you are interested in using SSH instead, you can follow the instructions here, but this is not recommended unless you are already familiar with SSH keys.
