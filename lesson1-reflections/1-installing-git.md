# Installing Git
Now we’re going to give you a chance to use Git and practice these commands on the Asteroids repository yourself. To do that, you’ll need to install Git. If you already have Git installed, check its version using the command `git --version`. If you have at least version 1.8, you can continue to the next video. Otherwise, we highly recommend upgrading, since Git added a lot of new features in version 1.8 and we will be assuming you have it.

If you haven’t already installed Git, or if you need to upgrade, go ahead and do so now by following the instructions here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

If you run into any problems, please post about them in the forums. Once you have Git installed, click “Next” and Caroline will walk you through how to download the Asteroids repository.
