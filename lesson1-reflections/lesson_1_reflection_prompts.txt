How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u Old_Version_File New_Version_File

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    git commit

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can save specific version to Git, unlike uploading is automatically in 
    Google docs. Besides, all files are automatically synchronized, you will spend
    much time to find which version is you really need to compare with.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    You can same sevveral files for the same time periods which is better. Because
    some of your codes will be done in several files, like HTML and CSS, Classes and 
    Fuctions in OOP programming languages.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat               (some statistics of your commit history)
    git diff Old_ID New_ID       (reveals which piece of codes you changed)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
